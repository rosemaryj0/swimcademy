            <h4>FAQ</h4>

            <h2>Why should I choose Swimcademy?</h2>
            <p>With Swimcademy, you're guaranteed to have a fully certified instructor with years of teaching experience, and a competitive swimming background. We are fully licensed by the Lifesaving Society to teach and evaluate to their standard, assuring your child will work on important skills that are transferrable to programs offered by the town and other organizations. Our instructors are dedicated to each swimmer and helping them succeed. We pride ourselves in our attention to technique and use personalized lesson plans to see results!<br><br></p>
          
            <h2>What ages do you teach?</h2>
            <p>We teach ages 3+, including teens and adults!<br><br></p>

            <h2>How many sessions should I register for?</h2>
            <p>This depends on your swimming goals. If you are looking to pass a Swim for Life level, we recommend registering for more than 1 session since 1 week is normally not enough time to fully master the skills required to pass a level.<br><br></p>
            
            <h2>What do I need to bring to my first lesson?</h2>
            <p>â€‹Please show up in your bathing suit as change rooms are unfortunately not yet available. Bring a towel, goggles (if needed), and your swimmer's previous report card (if applicable). We ask to please opt for a swim shirt instead of sunscreen, or apply any sunscreen at least 30 min before entering the pool. We have a child-size (30-60 lbs.) PFD for learning certain aquatic skills. You're free to bring your own but this isn't necessary. Also, make sure to use the bathroom before arrival.<br><br></p>

            <h2>Do you have a bathroom and change room?</h2>
            <p>We do not have a bathroom or change room facility available yet. We ask that you please use the bathroom before arrival, and arrive in your bathing suit. We apologize for the inconvenience.<br><br></p>

            <h2>What is your pool like?</h2>
            <p>Our backyard pool is a newly built, heated, salt water pool, and is 18' x 40' with a shallow and deep end, making it great for lessons for all ages. It is surrounded by shade trees, and we have chairs available for parents.<br><br></p>

            <h2>What is your policy for cancellations and refunds?</h2>
            <p>We have a no-cancellation and no-refund policy. Please remember that registering for a session is a commitment to attend all 5 days, and we cannot accommodate missed lessons.<br>Lessons will only be rescheduled in cases of severe weather (e.g. thunder, lightning, or torrential downpours). In these cases, a make-up lesson will be scheduled on Saturday or another available date. Lessons will continue as scheduled in light to moderate rain or other non-dangerous weather.<br><br></p>

            <h2>Can I register two swimmers in semi-private if they are at different levels?</h2>
            <p>We are happy to offer semi-private lessons to swimmers at the same level or within 1 level of each other. This is to ensure that instructors can teach and maintain supervision of both swimmers at the same time and plan lessons that are applicable to both swimmers. We ask that you please enrol your children in separate private lessons if this is not the case!<br><br></p>

            <h2>How do you accept payment?</h2>
            <p>We accept e-transfer, and we will send you details on payment in your confirmation email within 48hr upon completing the registration form. Please note that time slots are allocated on a first-come first-served basis, and payment is how you secure your spot. You may choose to pay in cash on the first day of your session, but your time slot will not be guaranteed until payment is made.<br><br></p>

            <h2>What is your referral discount?</h2>
            <p>We appreciate families who refer friends to Swimcademy! For every friend you refer who completes registration and mentions your name, you will receive a $25 discount on your next session. There is no limit to the number of discounts you can earn. Discounts apply only to future lessons and cannot be refunded for past payments. Registrations are considered complete once payment is received.<br><br></p>
          
            <h2>Where can I park?</h2>
            <p>There is some limited parking available in our driveway. Please note that there is no street parking directly in front of the house, however there is parking on the street just east of the house.<br><br></p>
